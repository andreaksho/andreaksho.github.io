									<h3>WELCOME</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Portrait.jpg" alt="AndreaPortrait" /></span>Hey everyone! That's me on the left! I'm currently in my fourth year at the <a href="http://www.sauder.ubc.ca/"> UBC Sauder School of Business</a> in the Marketing specialization.Throughout my years in university, I wasn't always happy about the field I was in. I know I didn't make the wrong choice when I picked the Marketing specilization over the other options such as Finance, Accounting, BTM, etc. Actually, I was very much enjoying the program, but it didn't feel like I was giving 100% all the time. Something was missing and I didn't know what it was.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/TheBeginnings.jpg" alt="JournalFirstPage" /></span>It was at the beginning of 2016 when a friend introduced the term "User Experience Design" to me. Being an artist, loving to understand how people behave, and driven by constant improvement in all things, I started to submerge myself into all kinds of online articles, random UX blogs, local workshops, and eventually started to look for a place to learn the fundamentals of User Experience. </p>
									<p>As I searched more and more about this topic, my interest grew along with it. Everyday I would set aside a couple hours just to read up about it. One of my New Years Resolutions for 2017 was to "Never Hold Back on Things I Love To Do." So at the beginning of the year, I decided to purchase a notebook dedicated to everything that was related to design. This just the was the beginning of a steep learning curve in my journey in UX. In early February, I enrolled into the UX Academy course at <a href="http://trydesignlab.com/">Designlab</a>. So far, I'm learning a ton load and excited to see what's in store everyday. I have had the opportunity to meet other UX students and mentors to guide me through.</p>
									<p> I'm so glad I've decided to explore this route and I don't regret any bit of it. What I've learned is to always engage in things you want to learn and fully commit to it. Not only that, I constantly tell myself to stay outside my comfort zone. This is how I got to where I am today, but it won't be where I am tomorrow. I can't wait for tomorrow, because I know I will know more than I do today.</p> 
									<p>Come follow me on my #ADesignADay journey, as I continuously challenge myself everyday and hopefully even inspire you to push yourself.</p>
